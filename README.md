# Quoridor game

- This is an implementation of board game Quoridor in C using GTK. 
- I wrote it using XCode which is because there is no `Makefile`.
- It was created in times in which I thought polish variable names are cool (they're not.).
- Code is commented in polish, because in the time of creation I wasn't aware of how unprofessional that is
